Key components of an SRS
The main sections of a software requirements specification are:

- Business drivers – this section describes the reasons the customer is looking to build the system, including problems with the currently system and opportunities the new system will provide.
- Business model – this section describes the business model of the customer that the system has to support, including organizational, business context, main business functions and process flow diagrams.
- Business/functional and system requirements -- this section typically consists of requirements that are organized in a hierarchical structure. The business/functional requirements are at the top level and the detailed system requirements are listed as child items.
- Business and system use cases -- this section consists of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case diagram depicting the key external entities that will be interacting with the system and the different use cases that they’ll have to perform.
- Technical requirements -- this section lists the non-functional requirements that make up the technical environment where software needs to operate and the technical restrictions under which it needs to operate.  
- System qualities -- this section is used to describe the non-functional requirements that define the quality attributes of the system, such as reliability, serviceability, security, scalability, availability and maintainability.
- Constraints and assumptions -- this section includes any constraints that the customer has imposed on the system design. It also includes the requirements engineering team’s assumptions about what is expected to happen during the project.
- Acceptance criteria -- this section details the conditions that must be met for the customer to accept the final system
