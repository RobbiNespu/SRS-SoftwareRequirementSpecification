## Purpose of an SRS
An SRS forms the basis of an organizationâ€™s entire project. It sets out the framework that all the development teams will follow. 

It provides critical information to all the teams, including development, operations, quality assurance (QA) and maintenance, ensuring the teams are in agreement.

Using the SRS helps an enterprise confirm that the requirements are fulfilled and helps business leaders make decisions about the lifecycle of their product, such as when to retire a feature. 

In addition, writing an SRS can help developers reduce the time and effort necessary to meet their goals as well as save money on the cost of development.
