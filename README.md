# Software Requirement Specification
SRS is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. 

The SRS fully describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.

An SRS minimizes the time and effort required by developers to achieve desired goals and also minimizes the development cost. 

A good SRS defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations. Parameters such as operating speed, response time, availability, portability, maintainability, footprint, security and speed of recovery from adverse events are evaluated. 

Methods of defining an SRS are described by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) specification 830-1998.
