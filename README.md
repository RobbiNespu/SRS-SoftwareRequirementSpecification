# Software Requirement Specification
SRS is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. 

The SRS fully describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.

An SRS minimizes the time and effort required by developers to achieve desired goals and also minimizes the development cost. 

A good SRS defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations. Parameters such as operating speed, response time, availability, portability, maintainability, footprint, security and speed of recovery from adverse events are evaluated. 

Methods of defining an SRS are described by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) specification 830-1998.


## Features of an SRS
### An SRS should have following characteristics:

- Correct -- should accurately reflect product functionality and specification at any point of time.
- Unambiguous -- should not be any confusion regarding interpretation of the requirements.
- Complete -- should contain all the features requested by a client.
- Consistent -- same abbreviation and conventions must be followed throughout the document.
Ranked for importance and/or stability -- every requirement is important. But some are urgent and must be fulfilled before other requirements and some could be delayed. It’s better to classify each requirement according to its importance and stability.
- Verifiable -- an SRS is verifiable only if every stated requirement can be verified. A requirement is verifiable if there is some method to quantifiably measure whether the final software meets that requirement.
- Modifiable -- an SRS must clearly identify each and every requirement in a systematic manner. If there are any changes, the specific requirements and the dependent ones can be modified accordingly without impact the others.
- Traceable – an SRS is traceable if the origin of each of its requirements is clear and if it makes it easy to reference each requirement in future development.

## The goals of an SRS
### Some of the goals an SRS should achieve are to:
- Provide feedback to the customer, ensuring that the IT company understands the issues the software system should solve and how to address those issues.
- Help to break a problem down into smaller components just by writing down the requirements.
- Speed up the testing and validation processes.
- Facilitate reviews.
